# UC_ToolTable
A UCCNC plugin for Lathe tool offseting and tool touchoff.  

This is a demo of a UCCNC plugin.  It shows how to do things such as implement jogging, indicate probe touch, work with DROs, change steps/unit, etc.

This is being provided as a demo for how to generate a plugin for UCCNC, and will be shared on UCCNC forum at www.forum.cncdrive.com in the plugins section :)

This code is provided with NO GUARANTEES.  It is considered fully open source, and you may do anything you wish with it.  Note the code is full of comments, commented
out code that isn't used, notes on what does and doesn't work, etc.  I actually utilize this plugin for operating a small lathe, but again, no gaurantees.
